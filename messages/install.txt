OverrideAudit
=============

OverrideAudit helps you keep track of all of your package overrides, easily
allowing you to see what overrides are in place, how they're different from the
file they're overriding and (most importantly) warning you when the file being
overridden has been updated by it's author.

An automated check for overrides that have "expired" in this manner is performed
every time you start Sublime text after upgrading it, as well as any time a
package is upgraded or installed. If any expired overrides are found, you'll be
told about it so you make sure everything is still OK.

One of these checks is performed when OverrideAudit is installed, so if you see
an extra tab telling you about expired overrides, Don't Panic! This is
OverrideAudit warning you that you have an override that might need your
attention.

You can view the README file for more information by selecting the appropriate
command from the Command Palette or from the OverrideAudit Preferences menu. The
README contains full information on OverrideAudit, including not only the list
of commands and configuration options available, but also a helpful terminology
reference.
