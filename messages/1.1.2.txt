Version 1.1.2 (2019-01-21)
-------------------------

  * Fix a bug in save_on_diff handling whereby the buffer might
    visually appear unsaved in some circumstances even though
    the file was actually saved.

  * Fix a bug introduced in 1.1.0 while fixing #24 which caused
    text in reports telling you that there are no overrides to
    be treated as an override.

  * Improve detection of packages that are dependency packages
    that are still under development so that they appear as
    appropriate in package reports (#25).

  * Include links to the online documentation in the settings
    menu and the command palette instead of opening the README
    file, since they contain the same information but one is
    hyperlinked and laid out better than the other one.
