Version 1.1.0 (2017-04-28)
--------------------------

  * Implement the ability to "freshen" a single expired override or
    all within a package (#15) via a context menu option

  * Implement the ability to show the diff header even if a diff is
    empty (#18) controlled via `diff_empty_hdr` option

  * Fix a problem with overrides starting with a period not being
    correctly recognized as an override (#24).

  * Fix a file case issue on Windows/MacOS where opening an override
    from a package folder with an incorrect case would not enable
    the commands to edit or diff the override.

  * Performance enhancements for some package operations for users
    with a large number of installed packages.
