Version 1.1.1 (2017-05-01)
--------------------------

  * Remove a debug print statement that slipped through during some
    last minute code testing prior to the last release.

In addition to the above, the following changes were made in version
1.1.0 on 2017-04-28 (3 days prior to this release), but a snafu
during the release process stopped PackageControl from showing the
changes when it upgraded the package.

For those that may have missed it, these are the changes that were
implemented in that version:

  * Implement the ability to "freshen" a single expired override or
    all within a package (#15) via a context menu option
  * Implement the ability to show the diff header even if a diff is
    empty (#18) controlled via `diff_empty_hdr` option
  * Fix a problem with overrides starting with a period not being
    correctly recognized as an override (#24).
  * Fix a file case issue on Windows/MacOS where opening an override
    from a package folder with an incorrect case would not enable
    the commands to edit or diff the override.
  * Performance enhancements for some package operations for users
    with a large number of installed packages.
