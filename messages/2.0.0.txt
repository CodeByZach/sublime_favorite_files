Version 2.0.0 (2019-03-13)
--------------------------

  * Lots of internal refactoring to make it easier to add in new
    commands and functionality. Outwardly, things are largely
    unchanged, but any customized key bindings, context menus,
    or command palette entries may need to be updated.

  * Context menu commands have been enhanced to allow for more
    customization options. Where they would previously hide
    themselves when they did not apply, they can now be made to
    remain visible and disable themselves instead.

  * The package report table frame was updated, because the lack
    of `+` characters is really hard to unsee once it's pointed
    out.

  For the full details of this change, check out the CHANGELOG.md
  file.
